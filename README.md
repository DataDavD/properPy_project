I have also been using this repo to improve my skills and knowledge of structuring python projects
and improving the development cycle with tools like pre-commit hooks, poetry, isort, black,
coverage, and flake8.

The repo contains a couple modules for basic math functions and an API for getting a Star Wars
character's DOB based on their name (or name substring).  Each module has a corresponding test
module.

Additionally, I added GitHub Actions CI support to further improve my knowledge of
Python project organization and structuring and how to deploy it using CI.
