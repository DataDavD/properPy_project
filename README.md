# Sandbox repo for improving Python testing knowledge and skills with pytest.

![CI](https://github.com/DataDavD/sandbox_pytest/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

I have also been using this repo to improve my skills and knowledge of structuring python projects
and improving the development cycle with tools like pre-commit hooks, poetry, isort, black,
coverage, and flake8.

Additionally, I added GitHub Actions CI support to further improve my knowledge of
Python project organization and structuring and how to deploy it using CI.
